								<h3>Abstract</h3>

								<p>Computer vision is becoming an increasingly critical area of research and its
									applications to real-world problems is growing at an incredible pace. We
									describe the design, development and evaluation of our computer vision iPad app for
									Sales Representatives in grocery store environments. Our system aims to assist Sales
									Reps to be more productive, reduce errors and provide increased efficiencies. We
									report on the creation of the iPad app, the design pattern for good detectors and the
									results of professional Sales Reps evaluating our system. Our system was tested in a
									variety of conditions in grocery store environments and has an accuracy of 96%, a
									SUS usability score of 85, and supports up to 40 detectors running concurrently to
									perform product identification in less than 5.9 seconds. We also created a design
									pattern to enable other researchers to create their own detectors for these types of
									products in complex environments (e.g., products with very similar packaging located
									on shelves). </p>

								<h3>The Problem</h3>

								<p>The way in which consumer packaged goods companies are keeping track of product availability
									and positioning at retail locations is not efficient. Currently, the most common approach
									involves having company representatives manually checking shelf layouts, stocks, position and
									orientation of products. Sales Reps assess stores to ensure they meet their client's standards
									and are compliant with contracts and protocols. At this time, virtually all of these processes are
									done manually with paper and pen using planograms (a diagram or model that indicates the placement
									of retail products on shelves to maximize sales). Of the relatively few apps available to
									support Sales Reps, they are limited in functionality and typically only address a small number of
									business-oriented questions using tablets.<p>


								<h3>Our Goals</h3>
								<p>The motivation behind this work is to enhance
									the use of mobile technologies in combination with computer vision to increase efficiencies of
									Sales Reps in the field. To this end, we set out to design and implement a system to accomplish
									this goal. The following list is the set of desirable characteristics we specified at the onset of the
									work:</p>

									<ol>
										<li>an advanced tool for Sales Reps to be more productive, reduce human errors, and
											increase their efficiencies;</li>
										<li>the detectors need to be accurate at recognizing objects of interest while discerning
											objects that are very similar (e.g., must distinguish between Minute Maid Original and
											Minute Maid Calcium);</li>
										<li>given an image of a grocery shelf containing potentially 50 different products, a
											successful detector must recognize at least one of several objects of interest (e.g., one
											Minute Maid Original from several on the shelf) and not identify any other products (no
											False Positives);</li>
										<li>the detectors need to be robust and operate successfully in a variety of conditions in
											grocery stores (e.g., variances in the lighting, orientation of products, obstructions, etc.);</li>
										<li>the implementation needs to be computationally efficient and run in real-time on the
											Sales Repâ€™s iPad without any network connectivity (the memory limitation is 1.5GB, and
											the system must be able to recognize up to 40 unique products within 20s)1;</li>
										<li>create a design pattern for the creation of training sets for other researchers to create their
											own detectors for similar types of products and environments (e.g. grocery shelves
											consisting of very similar products). The objective here is to create a repeatable design
											process that addresses similar problems.</li>
									</ol>

								<h4>Image Recognition - Tools and Technologies</h4>
								<p>One of our goals is to create accurate detectors that recognize objects of interest while discerning
									objects that are very similar. For example, the detector needs to distinguish between a Minute
									Maid Original product from a Minute Maid Calcium product. These two images in
									colour (as humans would see and differentiate between the two) and greyscale (as some
									computer vision systems see these images). The degree of similarities between these two images
									is quite subtle. It is difficult for the human eye to differentiate between these two amongst 50
									similar projects on shelves. It is more difficult to design an algorithm to detect these differences.</p>

								<p>After conducting a survey of candidate computer vision algorithms based on the following criteria: 
									(1) accuracy, (2) computational speed,
									(3) memory efficiency, (4) ease of use (i.e., implementation with supporting documentation), and
									(5) portability (for mobile device use). We evaluated the following computer vision algorithms
									using this criteria: Cascade Object Recognition Algorithm, Mean Shift Segmentation, and Support
									Vector Machines. During the review and evaluation process, it
									became clear that the Cascade Object Recognition Algorithm was the most feasible since it
									provided the greatest potential to satisfy the requirements of the proposed research.</p>

									<p>
										MATLAB was used to implement the Cascade Object Recognition Algorithm which we created a system
										for building object detectors relative to our products of interest. After testing during developement
										and once a level of 80% accuracy without false positives using real-life test images was achieved in
										MATLAB, we implemented the object recognition portion of our system as a native iPad app.
										The open source computer vision library (OpenCV) was used for the object recognition on
										the iPad. OpenCV is also used in MATLAB's Computer Vision System Toolbox,
										allowing our detectors to be ported from MATLAB to iOS.
